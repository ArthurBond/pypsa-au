# Installation

## Step 1. Clone GitHub Repository

Users can clone the repository using HTTPS, SSH, or GitHub CLI. See [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) for information on the different cloning methods. If you run into issues, follow GitHub troubleshooting suggestions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/troubleshooting-cloning-errors#https-cloning-errors).

### Using HTTPS

```console
git clone https://github.com/ArthurBond/pypsa-au.git
```

### Using SSH-Key

If it your first time cloning a **repository through ssh**, you will need to set up your git with an ssh-key by following these [directions](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent).

```console
git clone git@github.com:ArthurBond/pypsa-au.git
```
